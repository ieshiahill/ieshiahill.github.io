<h1>Who Am I?</h1>
<br />
<p>As a child I always had a pencil and paper or basketball in hand. I enjoyed sketching outdoors and I remember sketching my first logo personal branded logo when I was nine years old. I'm currently using the logo as we speak : )

As I got older, I realized that I had a passion for sports, especially basketball and art and went on to win state championships and basketball and art competitions throughout the state of Indiana.
