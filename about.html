<h1>Who Am I?</h1>
<br />

<p></p>

<p>As a child I always had a pencil and paper or basketball in hand. I enjoyed sketching outdoors and I remember sketching my first logo personal branded logo when I was nine years old. I'm currently using the logo as we speak : )
<br />
<br />
I've always had a strong desire to create and help others but I could never figure out how to combine the two. 
<br />
<br />
For the past five years I have worked in the oil and gas industry in numerous roles from customer service, sales and account management. Working in these roles have allowed me to create a strong foundation in customer-focus and problem solving. While working in account management, my responsibilities included manageing a portfolio of over 150 key accounts, fostering customer relationships, increasing customer revenue, collaborating with internal departments to help resolve customer issue and serve as the voice of the customer while understanding business goals.
<br />
<br />
I became intrigued by the tech industry while I was working with accounts. I would constantly hear the pains of my keys customers and it was up to me to figure out how to resolve those pains. The most frequent pain I received was difficulties using the online software system and features they would like added to help with their day-to-day business functions. I would them collaborate with the development team by suggesting adding new features or changing certain aspects of our website and mobile app. I was also able to participate in QA testing to provide more feedback on some of the cutting-edge technologies the development team was creating to help our customers. 
<br />
<br />
Although it was extremely cool to satisfy my customers by contributing new development technologies and features, my strong desire to create contstantly peeked and I wanted to be more involved with the creative process so I decided to explore a career in tech.
<br />
<br />
I became a student at the Eleven Fifty Academy (insert hyperlink) where I participated in an intensive 12-week coding bootcamp where I learned HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, Angular, Node.js and a few other technologies and software development skills. During my studies, I discovered User Experience Design which covered all of my strengths and passions by allowing me to combine my business, tech and creative skills to create user-centered digital solutions that positively impacted business goals as well. 
<br />
<br />
This helped cultivate my passion and career change into becoming a User Experience Designer.
<br />
<br />
Outside of working, I enjoy drawing, playing basketball, coaching basketball and volunteering in my community.
<br />
<br />
As a former athlete, I am passionate about the representation of women athletes in the media and because of that, I started created and developed my own sports media company highlighting women athletes at the high school, collegiate and professional level.

I also enjoy volunteering in the inner-city (inset photo of the caring place), (insert photo or me coaching basketball), (insert photo of my family), (insert photo of me with the startup ladies), (insert photo of me and basketball crew)
<br />
<br />
I enjoy working on projects that bring meaningful value to the lives of others.

I am thinker, creator and doer and I believe that you can do anything that you put your mind to no matter how the obstacles. 

faith, obedience, when something stands in my way, I know I can take it.

<!-- Trying to figure out how to word my about me section to make it a true representation of me - I don't want it to sound boring and I want the reader to truly get a feel of my personality and who I am from reading my about me - something they can't get from my resume and LinkedIn page -->

Who am I?

I am creator, a servant and a doer.

<h1>Creator (in bold)</h1>
<br />
<br />
<p>Ever since I was child, I've always had the desire to create. I enjoyed sketching shoes, Looney Toons characters and landscapes. I always have a pencil and paper in hand and I would sketch whenever I had the opportunity. When I was nine years old, I sketched my first logo and it's my personal logo that I still use to this day.</p>

<p>As an adult, my creativity transferred over into creating businesses, helping friends expand on their business ideas creating art and designing and developing web and mobile applications.</p>

<h1>Servant (in bold)</h1>
<br />
<br />
<p>I know my purpose is to serve others. Whether it's helping a family member or friend, volunteering my time to positively impact inner-city children, helping young girls build their self-confidence through sports and helping resolve customer issues.</p>

<h1>Doer (in bold)</h1>
<br />
<br />
<p>I know how to get things done. Period. I've experienced a lot of obstacles in life and as cliche as it may sound, I strongly believe that I can do anything that I put my mind to. I set goals and I crush them, no matter how challenging or long it may take.</p> 

<h1>>My journey</h1>
<br />
<br />
I spent my 20's learning about my strengths and weaknesses and discovering my true passions. I've worked in roles as a writer and editor, I've worked in customer service, sales and account management.
