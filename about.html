<h1>Who Am I?</h1>
<br />
<p>As a child I always had a pencil and paper or basketball in hand. I enjoyed sketching outdoors and I remember sketching my first logo personal branded logo when I was nine years old. I'm currently using the logo as we speak : )

I've always had a strong desire to create and help others but I could never figure out how to combine the two. 

For the past five years I have worked in the oil and gas industry in numerous roles from customer service, sales and account management. Working in these roles have allowed me to create a strong foundation in customer-focus and problem solving. While working in account management, my responsibilities included manageing a portfolio of over 150 key accounts, fostering customer relationships, increasing customer revenue, collaborating with internal departments to help resolve customer issue and serve as the voice of the customer while understanding business goals.

I became intrigued by the tech industry while I was working with accounts. I would constantly hear the pains of my keys customers and it was up to me to figure out how to resolve those pains. The most frequent pain I received was difficulties using the online software system and features they would like added to help with their day-to-day business functions. I would them collaborate with the development team by suggesting adding new features or changing certain aspects of our website and mobile app. I was also able to participate in QA testing to provide more feedback on some of the cutting-edge technologies the development team was creating to help our customers. 

Although it was extremely cool to satisfy my customers by contributing new development technologies and features, my strong desire to create contstantly peeked and I wanted to be more involved with the creative process so I decided to explore a career in tech.

I became a student at the Eleven Fifty Academy (insert hyperlink) where I participated in an intensive 12-week coding bootcamp where I learned HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, Angular, Node.js and a few other technologies and software development skills. During my studies, I discovered User Experience Design which covered all of my strengths and passions by allowing me to combine my business, tech and creative skills to create user-centered digital solutions that positively impacted business goals as well. 

This helped cultivate my passion and career change into becoming a User Experience Designer.
              
I enjoy working on projects that bring meaningful value to the lives of others.
