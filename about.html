<h1>I am creator, a servant and a doer.</h1>

<h1>Creator</h1>
<p>Ever since I was child, I've always had the desire to create. As a kid I enjoyed sketching shoes, Looney Toons characters and landscapes. I always have a pencil and paper in hand and I would sketch whenever I had the opportunity. When I was nine years old, I sketched my first logo and it's my personal logo that I still use to this day.</p>

<p>As an adult, my creativity transferred over into creating businesses, helping friends expand on their business ideas, creating art, and designing and developing web and mobile applications.</p>

<h1>Servant</h1>
<p>My purpose is to serve others. Whether it's helping a stranger, a family member or friend, volunteering my time to positively impact the lives of inner-city children, helping young girls build their self-confidence through sports and helping resolve customer issues.</p>

<h1>Doer</h1>
<p>I know how to get things done. Period. As cliche as it may sound, I strongly believe that through my faith, I can do anything that I put my mind to. I set goals and I crush them, no matter how challenging the goal may be.</p> 

<h1>My Career Journey</h1>
<p>I spent my 20's figuring out my strengths and my weaknesses and discovering my true passions. I've worked in roles writing and editing content, customer service, sales and account management and I think I've finally figured what my strengths and how I can fulfill my passions in my career every single day.
<br />
<p>In my previous role as account manager, I managed a portfolio of over 100 key customers. I throughly enjoyed this role because I learned so much! I was able to foster relationships with key executives and stakeholders from all over the country, I helped them solve their business problems, I was able to learn from the CEO and other salesman who held decades of experience and was able to truly learn how a business worked from an . My favorite aspect of this role was that I able to listen to the pains of my key customers and create solutions that would improve their entire customer experience. This normally entailed working with the software development team to create or modify features on the software system and the mobile app. It was my job to ensure that their experience using our software improved which in return would increase the revenue allowing me to hit my sales goals. 
<br />

In this role, I was able to participate in QA sessions and see digital products go from an idea to launch. I became fascinated with it and I wanted to be more hands on with creating software products so I decided to explore a career in tech.
<br />

I became a student at the Eleven Fifty Academy where I participated in an intensive 12-week JavaScript coding bootcamp. During my studies, I discovered User Experience Design and I immediately fell in love because it covered all of my strengths and passions by allowing me to combine my business, tech and creative skills to create user-centered digital solutions that positively impacted business goals as well.</p>
